$UNIX2003
- Appears to only be present in 32-bit binaries.
- Open Question: compatibility between the 32-bit mangled version and the 64-bit unmangled version?
  => Most answers indicate `yes, is compatible'.
$INODE64
- Appears to be present in both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, so shouldn't be touched.


General:
abigen can generate both copies, the standard as well as the mangled version.

TODO: also accept dynamic libraries as command-line arguments. Take the intersection of the symbols in these with the symbols defined in the headers.
