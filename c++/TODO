How to solve data-in-code problem?
1. Do 2nd pass that checks unresolved pointers and reconsiders instructions at that address. 


[X] Rebasing issues -- some instructions need rebasing, e.g. jmp dword ptr [0x2000]
[ ] More rebasing issues -- some pushes need rebasing, e.g. push 0x8200
    RebaseInfo needs to be able to go back and populate instructions.
    Perhaps instructions should also parse immediate operands and add them as subblobs within the
    instruction.

    Possible Solution:
    (1) Convert InstructionPointer to Immediate
    (2) Make 'pointee' field optional
    (3) Add 32-bit 'value' field; used when 'pointee == nullptr'


[ ] Add callback to resolver.
